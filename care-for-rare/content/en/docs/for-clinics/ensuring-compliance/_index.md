The security and confidentiality of your data is our priority. For this reason, we use federated learning, a machine learning approach that does not require any data transfer to a centralized server or cloud. Instead, it allows the user to retrieve the model and run it on their data locally. 

FeatureCloud provides an all-in-one federated learning platform and mediates the secure exchange and useability of the machine learning applications.

This ensures a complete separation of clinical data from the development environment and allows research partners from different clinics to collaborate without facing any data privacy restrictions or risking a central point of attack.  
Inference, results and predictions of the machine learning models used for diagnosis is in full control of the clinics and they can choose to update the global machine learning model as they see fit. If clinics decide to share their results with other entities, they must do so explicitly.
