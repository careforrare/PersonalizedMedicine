FeatureCloud is a lightweight pan-European AI development project aimed at mitigating cyber risks to healthcare infrastructure. Their focus is on creating innovative software toolkits employing federated learning with an all-in-one approach. 

FeatureCloud addresses the main obstacles of AI and clinical data with two key characteristics: (1) no sensitive data is sent through any communication channels, and (2) data is not stored in one central point of attack.
