Federated machine learning with a dual graph approach, embedded in a self-sustaining ecosystem, is revolutionising rare disease research: Patient data remains securely on hospital servers and never leaves them - maximising privacy. At the same time, the technology enables everyone from experienced software architects to the passionate mother of an affected child to develop algorithms and contribute to improved diagnostics. This model encourages innovation and collaboration without compromising sensitive healthcare data - a critical step towards faster and more accurate care.
