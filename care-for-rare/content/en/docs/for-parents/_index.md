## SCIVIAS Study at Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital
The SCIVIAS study at the Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital focuses on the examination of children with rare diseases in order to identify biomarkers that enable early diagnosis. 
Various methods are used for this purpose, including imaging of the fundus oculi, OMICS analyses of blood and urine and artificial intelligence methods for data analysis. The aim is to use a simple and painless examination to detect a disease before the child is sick.

Data collection within the Scivias study involves several steps and methods that are carefully carried out in order to obtain accurate and meaningful information.
- Imaging of the fundus oculi: High-resolution images of the back of the eye are taken to identify eye problems that may indicate certain genetic diseases. Modern equipment and technologies are used to obtain precise and detailed images.
- OMICS analyses: This includes various "OMICS" technologies such as genome sequencing, transcriptome analysis, proteome and metabolome analysis. These methods enable the comprehensive analysis of genetic, transcriptional and metabolic profiles of the children. By analysing this data, potential biomarkers that indicate certain diseases can be identified.
- Artificial intelligence (AI) methods: Artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning are used to process the large and complex data sets and identify patterns or biomarkers. These algorithms help to extract relevant information from the data and recognise diagnostic patterns.

The security and processing of data are of crucial importance, particularly in the area of data protection and ethics. The following measures are taken:
- Anonymisation and pseudonymisation: personal identification data is removed or encrypted to ensure patient anonymity.
- Secure data transmission and storage: Secure protocols are used for the transmission and storage of data to ensure its integrity and confidentiality.
- Access control: Access to data is strictly controlled and only granted to authorised persons to prevent misuse or unauthorised disclosure.
- Ethics committees and data protection guidelines: The study will be overseen by ethics committees and clear privacy policies will be established to ensure that the rights and privacy of participants are protected.
  
Through these careful measures in data collection, processing and security, the SCIVIAS study endeavours to achieve high-quality and ethically acceptable results that can contribute to improving the early detection and treatment of rare diseases in children.
