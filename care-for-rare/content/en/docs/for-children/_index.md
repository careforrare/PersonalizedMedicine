## SCIVIAS Study at Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital

The SCIVIAS study at Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital examines children with rare diseases to find out how these diseases can be detected at an early stage.
We do various tests, for example we look at the eyes, examine the blood and urine and even use computers to analyse the results.
Our aim is to find out whether a child has a disease before he or she is really unwell. 

To get the information we need, we take many careful steps:
- We take pictures of the eyes to see if we can find any evidence of disease there.
- We analyse the blood and urine to look for specific substances that could tell us if the child is ill.
- We use computers to analyse the data and see if there are patterns that tell us something about the child's health.

It is important that the data we collect is secure and that we protect children's privacy. To do this, we do the following:
- We remove or encrypt personal data so that no one knows who the data came from.
- We use secure ways to transfer and store the data so that it cannot be lost or stolen.
- Only certain people have access to the data to ensure that it remains secure.
- There are also specific rules and groups in place to make sure we do everything ethically and correctly.

By taking all these precautions, we want to ensure that we get good results that can help us recognise and treat diseases in children in time.
