Graph data model is a widely used framework to describe and analyze relationships between entities in a dataset. In a graph data model, data is organized into nodes representing objects or entities in a dataset and edges representing the relationships between the nodes. A node can have attributes or properties describing its characteristics and an edge can be directed, bidirected or undirected. 

Graph data models are particularly well-suited for modeling complex relationships and networks, such as social networks, biological networks, transportation networks, and knowledge graphs. They enable efficient querying, traversal, and analysis of interconnected data, allowing for the discovery of patterns, insights, and dependencies within the dataset.
 
## Knowledge Graph

A Knowledge Graph is a representation of a knowledge domain using the graph data model, readable by both humans and machines. 
Knowledge graphs are used to model complex information in a way that can be easily understandable. They can use ontologies to define the structures of classes, properties and relationships in a domain knowledge to ensure consistency and allow compatibility between different graphs.
