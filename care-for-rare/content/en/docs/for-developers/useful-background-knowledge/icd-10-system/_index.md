The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a standardized system used worldwide for classifying diseases, health conditions, and related factors. ICD-10, which is the latest revision, provides a comprehensive framework for organizing and categorizing diseases and health conditions based on their etiology, anatomical location, severity, and other relevant factors.

ICD-10 codes are alphanumeric codes that represent specific diseases, conditions, and medical procedures. These codes are used in healthcare settings for billing, recording, reporting, analyzing and clinical decision-making.
