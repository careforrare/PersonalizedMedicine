title: Children’s rights
weight: 4
---

All children and young people have rights. They were laid down by the United Nations in 1989 in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC: <a href="https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention" class="link-underline-primary">Convention on the Rights of the Child | UNICEF</a>). All countries in the world (with the exception of the USA) have undertaken to respect and implement children's rights in their country and to monitor their implementation. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child defines rights to protection, promotion and participation and states that the best interests of the child must always be the primary consideration. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is not only important for the healthcare system because of the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the best possible medical treatment.

The Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital respects the rights of sick children and adolescent patients and at the same time recognizes that overriding structural requirements still stand in the way of comprehensive implementation of the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This charter is based on the charters of renowned international children's hospitals (Boston Children's Hospital, SickKids Toronto, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades Paris, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital London) and the Charter on the Rights of Children in Hospital drawn up by the European Association for Children in Hospital. The Hauner Charta helps to strengthen the rights of sick children and adolescent patients and to better implement them in everyday clinical practice.
