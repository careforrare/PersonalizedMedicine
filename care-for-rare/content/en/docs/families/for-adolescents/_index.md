In Munich, there is this place called Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital. It’s pretty significant because it specializes in treating kids with serious and long-lasting illnesses. It’s been around since 1846 when Dr. August von Hauner started it all up.

Nowadays, it’s not just serving kids from Munich or Bavaria; it’s drawing patients from all over Germany and even internationally. They’re all about providing top-notch care tailored specifically for kids. And they’re constantly looking for ways to improve their treatments by collaborating with other hospitals and experts.

At Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital, they understand the importance of respecting how kids perceive the world. They don’t just treat their patients; they also value their input. They think it’s crucial for kids to be involved in improving medical care.

They’re even part of this big project called the German Centre for Child and Adolescent Health, where they’re working on making medical treatments more personalized and precise, especially for kids.

**So, if you’re a teen dealing with a rare illness, this place is here to offer you hope and do everything they can to help you get better.**

Hey, so there’s this really interesting study happening at Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital called the SCIVIAS study. They’re focusing on kids with rare diseases to see if they can detect any signs that might show up before they actually get sick.

One thing they’re doing is using advanced machines to take detailed images of the back of the kids’ eyes. This helps them identify any abnormalities that could indicate a specific genetic disease.

They’re also analysing different substances in the kids’ blood and urine to look for clues. It’s kind of like being detectives, but instead of solving crimes, they’re trying to solve health mysteries!

And here’s where it gets really cool—they’re using artificial intelligence (AI) to process all the data they collect. This AI helps them find patterns and correlations in the information, which can lead to better understanding and early detection of diseases.

Of course, they’re taking privacy and security seriously. They make sure all the data is protected and anonymized so that nobody’s personal information is at risk.

Overall, the goal of the SCIVIAS study is to find ways to identify rare diseases early on, so that doctors can provide better treatment and care for kids. It’s pretty fascinating stuff!

## AMIGO

So, there’s this project called “AMIGO: Advanced Medical Intelligence for Guiding Omics-based Medicine”, run by Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital in Munich. They’re trying to help kids with rare diseases, who often get left out in medicine.

When a kid goes to the clinic, they collect a bunch of data about their medical history and symptoms. They use forms, blood and pee tests, and check-ups. They even do things like genome tests and fancy eye scans. Then, smart people called bioinformaticians analyze all this data. But here’s the thing: even with all this info, they only figure out what’s wrong about 30% of the time, especially for rare diseases that are mostly genetic. And for over 95% of rare diseases, there isn’t even a medicine that’s been tested and approved yet! This makes things really tough for the doctors, as well as the kids and their families.

So, the AMIGO project wants to do something about it. They want to get more knowledge from all this data. And they’re keeping it all safe and private while they do this. They’re using this thing called federated machine learning to analyze the data. It’s like they’re using a special tool that lets them analyze data from different hospitals without actually moving the data out of each hospital’s secure system.

By putting all this info into something called a “Clinical Knowledge Graph”, scientists and doctors from all over the world can use it to learn and help diagnose diseases faster and more accurately. This could lead to better treatments and maybe even new medicines!

And here’s the interesting part: it’s not just about helping kids. The stuff they learn could also be used to improve treatments for adults with things like heart or brain problems. So, it’s like they’re using data to help everyone live healthier lives.
