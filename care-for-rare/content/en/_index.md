Welcome to Project “AMIGO: Advanced Medical Intelligence for Guiding Orphan Medicine”.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
Our project, launched and managed by Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital in Munich, Germany, aims to give hope to children with rare diseases, known as the orphans of medicine. By integrating Machine Learning (ML) and following a decentralized approach, it will be possible to analyze and link children’s clinical and genetic data with the highest level of data security. The knowledge gained will be used to train an AI and thus help doctors around the world to diagnose and treat patients in an individual and personalized way.

Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital is the Pediatric Clinic of the University Hospital of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. It is a reference center for many children with severe, chronic or complex diseases. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, everyday life is characterized by science and research.

Driven by the passion to improve clinical care for children with rare and common diseases, interdisciplinary research teams collaborate on a variety of themes centered on pediatric health issues. The focus is on studying biological factors governing child development as well as on designing innovative therapeutic strategies.

At Dr. von Hauner, one follows the believe that children also have a right to participate in medical progress. Therefore, the clinic, its physicians and medical staff work closely together with the patients and their families. The aim is to understand the basics of diseases to derive new ways of diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

Personalized, predictive and participatory precision medicine is the primary goal of the actions taken.

<h2>AMIGO</h2>
<p class="fs-5"><strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>M</strong>edical <strong>I</strong>ntelligence for <strong>G</strong>uiding <strong>O</strong>rphan Medicine</p>

Join us in integrating the potential of Artificial Intelligence into the healthcare sector. Project AMIGO is committed to applying federated machine learning and clinical knowledge graphs, so that children with rare diseases can receive a rapid diagnosis and targeted treatment. 

Use our knowledge graphs and our project descriptions to support this progress! 

**Just because it is called *rare*, doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect us all.**

<h2>What is the&nbsp;<div class="d-inline-flex -bg-primary p-1 rounded">
<h2 class="-text-white fw-bold m-0">Care for Rare</h2>
</div>&nbsp;foundation?
</h2>
<p>
The Care-for-Rare Foundation is helping children with rare diseases. Children with rare diseases are the
orphans of medicine. They are overshadwed in many ways: Odysseys from doctor to doctor and frequent
misdiagnoses define their lives. Many rare diseases are still incurable. Only through increased research
efforts and international cooperation can this fate be changed. </p>
<p>The Care-for-Rare Foundation helps across national borders to give children with rare diseases hope for a
cure – regardless of their origin or financial means. It bases its commitment on the guiding principle
of “recognize – understand – cure”.
