## What is the Care-for-Rate Foundation?
The Care-for-Rare Foundation is helping children with rare diseases. Children with rare diseases are the orphans of medicine. They are overshadwed in many ways: Odysseys from doctor to doctor and frequent misdiagnoses define their lives. Many rare diseases are still incurable. Only through increased research efforts and international cooperation can this fate be changed. 

The Care-for-Rare Foundation helps across national borders to give children with rare diseases hope for a cure -- regardless of their origin or financial means. It bases its commitment on the guiding principle of “recognize -- understand -- cure”.

Actions taken:
- Promoting development of new therapies
- Financing the further training of doctors and scientists
- Raising awareness of rare diseases
- Helps in individual cases through clinical treatment

The starting point for these activities is the Care-for-Rare Center at the Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital of the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich.
